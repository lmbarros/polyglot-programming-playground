# Handmade HTML Comics Experiments

* **Experiment 01:** First experiment, from 02011-10-23. Everything is very rigid.

* **Experiment 02:** From 02011-12-03. Much more flexible. The same background image can be used in panels of different sizes, or used multiple times in panels of the same size. The panels themselves are drawn over everything else, so that different panel styles (normal rectangle, thought bubble...) can be easily used. Also, uses a "custom" font (Komika Slick).

* **Komika Web Fonts:** Ready to use! Intially generated in [Fontie](http://fontie.pixelsvsbytes.com), then hand-edited.

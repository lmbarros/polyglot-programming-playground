# A reasonable hex grid

Playing with hex grids, in a more focused way than in my
`Hex_Grids_in_Breadth_in_Rust` experiment. Here I am focusing specifically in:

* A rectangular-shaped grid
* Pointy-top hexes
* Axial coordinates

Again, the main reference is the excellent [Red Blob Games' Hexagonal
Grids](https://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons/) article by Amit Patel.
